# coderstent-hacksprint
A web/browser-based tool to detect and flag misinformation on social media platforms, developed for HackSprint 2025.

## Project: Fact-Checking and Misinformation Detection Tool

Hey there! We're Team Coderstent, and this is our project for HackSprint 2025. We're tackling the ever-growing issue of misinformation online, and we're stoked to build something that can make a real difference.

### Project Description:

Our goal is to create a user-friendly tool (probably a browser extension to start) that helps people identify potential misinformation while they're browsing social media. We know that fake news spreads fast, so we want to give users a quick and easy way to check the validity of what they're reading. We're still figuring out the backend, could be Flask, could be Next.js/Express, but the idea is to use some clever tech (like NLP) to analyze content and flag anything that seems fishy.

### HackSprint 2025 Theme Alignment:

This project fits squarely into the **Tech for Social Good** theme. We believe that technology can be a powerful force for positive change, and combating misinformation is a challenge that we're passionate about addressing. We want to empower users to be more informed and make better decisions about what they read and share online.

### Core MVP Features:

For the MVP, we're focusing on these key features:

1. **Real-time Text Analysis:** The tool will analyze text content on social media pages as the user browses.
2. **Misinformation Flagging:**  When potentially false or misleading information is detected, the tool will visually flag it for the user (maybe with a subtle highlight or icon).
3. **Source Cross-Referencing:**  We'll try to connect flagged content with reputable fact-checking sources (like Snopes or PolitiFact) to provide users with more context.

We are thinking of using React and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, maybe with a UI library like Aceternity to make things look slick. The backend is TBD, but either way, we're aiming for a smooth and intuitive user experience.

### Getting Started:

We'll update this section soon with instructions on how to get the project up and running locally. Stay tuned!
